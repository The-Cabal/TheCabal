# TheCabal
What are we?



The Cabal is an anarchy based group of hackers. We primarily play on oldfag.org and 2b2t.org.

A cabal is a group of people who are united in some close design, usually to promote their private views or interests in an ideology, a state, or another community, often by intrigue and usually unbeknownst to those who are outside their group. The use of this term usually carries negative connotations of political purpose, conspiracy and secrecy.

We look forward to having some projects and making mods!
